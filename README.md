# Mysli

**My** **S**hopping **Li**st. Simple app created for my own usage. My first app built with React.

## Notes

- Trying to always have fontsizes & spacings dividible by 6
  - For continuity

## Ideas

- Clean code
  - ticked = checked everywhere (cuz bouncyCheckox uses it)
- List
  - Trash icon to delete ticked items
  - Grey text for ticked items
  - Reorder items
  - Remember item positions
- Adding items
  - Suggest old previously added items
    - Hold suggestion to delete
  - Drag cursor color
- Theme
  - Can change colors
  - Create spacing util
  - Dark theme
- Quality check
  - Check UI on different sized phone
- Settings screen
  - See item order array
