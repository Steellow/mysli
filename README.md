**My** **S**hopping **Li**st. Simple app created for my own usage. My first app built with React Native.

## Stuff

- Item object properties
  - `value`
  - `checked`

## Ideas

- List
  - Remember item positions
  - Ability to pin items (always reappear when opening the app)
  - Disable trash icon if no checked items
  - Seperate items more clearly? Would make tapping/dragging easier
  - ListItem
    - Opening app, disabled items are not checked
  - Bottom item clips when scrolling
  - Fix laggy checkbox animation
    - Do custom component? Good way to learn animations
- Adding items
  - Suggest old previously added items
    - Hold suggestion to delete
  - Drag cursor color
  - Placeholder text
  - Position at bottom
  - Toast if item already exists
- Theme
  - Can change colors
  - Create spacing util
  - Dark theme
- Quality check
  - Check UI on different sized phone
- Settings screen
  - See item order array
  - See pinned items
- Other
  - Handle errors (AsyncStorageHelper)
  - Splash screen when loading items
- Clean code
  - Custom items hook
